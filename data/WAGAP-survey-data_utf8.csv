Maybe it would help if there was a way for the foodbank to deliver food to people who are unable to get to the foodbank on the days the foodbank is open or maybe deliver food on a day it's closed so it doesn't interfere with their business hours and take away from the people who can get to the foodbank. Or maybe have a small foodbank in Carson that is open on days that the foodbank isnt open in Stevenson or Bingen to make it easier for people that can't come on Tuesday and Thursday. Thank you for your time and support. ,
